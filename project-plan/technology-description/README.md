# Technology Description 
 
## Language 
 
We landed on python as the language for building our system.   
Python is [widely used in industry, highly versatile](https://skillcrush.com/blog/what-is-python-used-for/), and familiar to all of our group   
members, so it is the language for us. 
 
## Framework 
 
Python also has a plethora of very useful [open-source libraries](https://skillcrush.com/blog/what-is-python-used-for/), such as our web framework of choice: Flask. Flask is [widely used and has extensive documentation and community support](https://medium.com/@lauren-fox/why-should-you-use-flask-framework-for-web-development-f5a7233e17a6), so if we   
run into a problem while using it, chances are, there exists a forum post containing numerous solutions. It also has very [similar syntax to python](https://medium.com/@lauren-fox/why-should-you-use-flask-framework-for-web-development-f5a7233e17a6), which will make it easier to understand for our members that are unfamiliar with the framework, and it is also excellent for [prototyping and rapid testing](https://medium.com/@lauren-fox/why-should-you-use-flask-framework-for-web-development-f5a7233e17a6), which is useful for debugging. 
 
## Storage Plan 
 
We will use JSON for storage in our project.
