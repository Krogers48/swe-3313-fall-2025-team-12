Version #

    Epic Name and unique ID (write these like a use case bubble - very brief, but specific enough to be clear what we are doing) I suggest something like T (for team) and # and E and a number for your epic id. For example, T9E-2.
        Story Name and unique ID (name should also have subject and a verb, but shorter than description). I suggest something like T (for team) and # and S and a number for your story ID. For example, T9S-12.
            Priority (Must Have, Needs to Have, Wants to Have)
            Estimated Effort (no less than 1/4 day, no greater than 5 days)
            Functional or Non-Functional (choose one)
            Story description (must have a subject and a verb and be long enough to prevent ambiguity)
