# Technical Design  
  
  
## A. Implementation Languages  
What did we choose and why?
- Python [(documentation can be found here)](https://docs.python.org/3.13/)
    - Widely used
    - Easily understandable syntax
    - Plethora of open-source libraries
    - Highly Versatile
    - Allows us to use the Flask framework
    - Can be run on most machines
    - Thought the dev team would be most comfortable with this one out of C#, Java, and Python
- HTML [(documentation can be found here)](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/)
    - Widely used
    - Used for building screens in Flask
    - It is the standard markup language for web pages
    - Easy to learn
    - HTML 5 is supported by nearly every browser
    




Resources:  
- Python
    - [Official Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) (however, the one by [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) may be more digestible).
    - Here is a [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/kqtD5dpn9C8?si=EqYCUyNkuxOwwOyL) if you prefer that.

- HTML
    - W3C - one of the organizations that maintains HTML - has an excellent HTML tutorial on their website [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/).  
    - Here is a [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/qz0aGYrrlhU?si=jb5wg_vrxS3lr33E) if you prefer that.
    
- Extra help
    - [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) has high quality, concise articles on almost every programming topic; they are an excellent resource for coders of all experience levels.  
    - You can never go wrong with searching [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions). There is a high chance that someone there has asked your exact question before, and has gotten multiple, very good, answers. 
- I highly recommend using a [JetBrains IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/) for this project, as you are provided with a license.

## B. Implementation Framework(s)  
What did we choose and why?
- Flask [(documentation can be found here)](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/)
    - Widely used
    - Extensive documentation & community support
    - Similar syntax to python
    - Fast and efficient
    - Flexible
    - Good for prototyping and rapid testing
    - Our only choice for a python framework in this project
- Bootstrap [(documentation & installation can be found here)](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/)
    - Widely used
    - Extensive documentation & community support
    - Extremely useful for creating webpages
    - Contains many useful premade classes and templates
    - Does much of the CSS for us
    - Very Flexible
    - Quick prototyping
    - Useful for event-driven programming

Resources:  
- Flask
    - Here is a [good article on the benefits of Flask](https://medium.com/@lauren-fox/why-should-you-use-flask-framework-for-web-development-f5a7233e17a6).  
    - Instructions for flask installation can be found [here](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/installation/).  
    - [This playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJJcOjd3n1Zddc1RmIhkjmND7qKS6WGiC&si=fvHHbvakO0MJvBoZ) is an excellent tutorial on creating a python web app using flask.
  
- Bootstrap
    - Here is a [good article on the benefits of bootstrap](https://www.clarity-ventures.com/blog/benefits-of-using-bootstrap-for-web-design).  
    - Here is a [list of all bootstrap classes](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_ref_all_classes.asp).  
    - Here are a few bootstrap tutorials: [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/), [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bootstrap/bootstrap-tutorial/), [Web Dev Simplified](https://youtu.be/Jyvffr3aCp0?si=h6564wBFPQ56axJZ).
