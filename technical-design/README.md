## A. Implementation Languages  
What did we choose and why?
- Python [(documentation can be found here)](https://docs.python.org/3.13/)
    - Widely used
    - Easily understandable syntax
    - Plethora of open-source libraries
    - Highly Versatile
    - Allows us to use the Flask framework
    - Can be run on most machines
- HTML [(documentation can be found here)](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/)
    - Used for building screens in Flask
    - It is the standard markup language for web pages
    - Widely used
    - Easy to learn
    - HTML 5 is supported by nearly every browser
    


For help with HTML: W3C - one of the organizations that maintains HTML - has an excellent HTML tutorial on their website [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/).  
    
For help with python: There is an [official tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) made by the Python organization, but the one by [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) may be more digestable.  
  
For help with specific programming questions, [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) has high quality, concise articles on almost every programming topic; they are an excellent resource for coders of all experience levels.  
  
If all else fails, you can never go wrong with searching [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions). There is a high chance that someone on there has asked your exact question before, and has gotten multiple, very good, answers.
